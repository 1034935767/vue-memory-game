A tiny game written in vue. It's inspired by IgorMinar's [Memory-Game](https://github.com/IgorMinar/Memory-Game). You can view the online demo [here](http://leftstick.github.io/vue-memory-game).

We choose `single-file-component` pattern as the fundamental of this game. In order to use this pattern, we involved [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) with [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) to make it possible.
